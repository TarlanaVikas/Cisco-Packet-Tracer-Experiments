# Cisco Packet Tracer Experiments

This repository contains a set of networking experiments designed using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
Each experiment demonstrates fundamental networking concepts and configurations.

## Contents

### Lab 2 – Bus Topology Network using Switches  
This experiment demonstrates how multiple devices can be connected in a bus topology using switches.  
It highlights data flow across a shared medium and the limitations of scalability in such a design.

### Lab 3 – LAN Network using a Single Switch  
This lab shows how a local area network can be built with a single switch.  
It emphasizes efficient communication between connected hosts within a confined network area.

### Lab 4 – MAN Network using a Single Router  
This experiment illustrates the setup of a metropolitan area network using a single router.  
It focuses on connecting multiple LANs across a larger geographic region for extended communication.

### Lab 5 – Creating and Configuring 2 VLANs  
This lab explores how to segment a network into two VLANs on a switch.  
It demonstrates logical separation of devices to improve security and manageability.

### Lab 6 – Port-Security Configuration to Prevent MAC Address Spoofing  
This experiment teaches how to configure port security on switches.  
It shows how restricting MAC addresses can prevent unauthorized access and enhance network protection.

### Lab 7 – Router Serial Point-to-Point Connection (HDLC, PPP)  
This lab sets up a point-to-point connection between routers using HDLC and PPP protocols.  
It highlights how serial links enable direct communication and protocol differences in encapsulation.

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` files in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
2. Explore the topology and configuration steps provided in each lab.  
3. Practice and modify the experiments to strengthen your understanding of networking concepts.

## Notes

- These experiments are intended for educational purposes.  
- Each lab builds on core networking principles and can be studied independently.
